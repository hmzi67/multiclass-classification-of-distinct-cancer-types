Project: RNA-Seq Cancer Classification Analysis
Author: hmzi67
Created: 2025-06-13 07:12:05 UTC
Repository: https://github.com/hmzi67/rna-seq-cancer-classification

This project analyzes RNA-Seq gene expression data for cancer classification
using machine learning techniques. The implementation includes comprehensive
data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and multiple ML algorithms
for accurate cancer type prediction.
